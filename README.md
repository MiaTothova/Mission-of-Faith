Mission of Faith is a website designed to showcase and advertise this Christian Evangelical church located in Ennis Co. Clare. Its main goal is to provide useful information about the church and what programs it runs on a weekly basis. Its main objective is to showcase its importance and place in the local community. The Gallery page is full of images from past sermons and events, showcasing its attention to detail and especially its involvement in children's development and focusing on their youth members.   

#### The Business goals of the website are:
* To increase awareness among the Christian community about the importance of living by the scripture. 
* To spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to non-believers. 
* To invite curious non-members to visit the church.
#### The customers visit the website to:
*  Learn more about the church and its Pastors. 
*  Learn about the weekly programs that are run. 
* Watch the “sermon of the week” that gets published every week.
* See pictures from past events.
* To find its contact and location.
* To establish contact with the pastors or members of the team.
