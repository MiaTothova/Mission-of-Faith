Mission of Faith is a website designed to showcase and advertise this Christian Evangelical church located in Ennis Co. Clare. Its main goal is to provide useful information about the church and what programs it runs on a weekly basis. Its main objective is to showcase its importance and place in the local community. The Gallery page is full of images from past sermons and events, showcasing its attention to detail and especially its involvement in children's development and focusing on their youth members.   

#### The Business goals of the website are:
* To increase awareness among the Christian community about the importance of living by the scripture. 
* To spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to non-believers. 
* To invite curious non-members to visit the church.
#### The customers visit the website to:
*  Learn more about the church and its Pastors. 
*  Learn about the weekly programs that are run. 
* Watch the “sermon of the week” that gets published every week.
* See pictures from past events.
* To find its contact and location.
* To establish contact with the pastors or members of the team. 


# UX
I aimed to create a website that is simple to navigate and follow. I aimed for a simplistic design with light colors so that it is easy to read without being too overwhelming on the eyes. 

### The ideal client:
* English speaking 
* Located in Ennis Co. Clare and surrounding area
* Christian or is curious about Christianity 
* Values involvement in the local community 
### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website 
* Find the contact and location 
* Learn about the church and its pastors 
* Find the specific days of programs that are run each week
* Use the form provided to request a call back or ask aquestion
* See Images of its church community from past events 

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to know what the website is about. 
2. As a new visitor, I want to learn about the aim of the website, what it is about and who runs the congregation.  
3. As a new visitor, I want to know what the usual program schedule is. 
4. As a new visitor, I want to connect to any social media pages the church has. 
5. As a new visitor, I want to see the best way to contact the church. 


### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:
* Header containing the logo and the menu bar including Home, Gallery and Contact Us links. 
* Home page split into 3 sections : 
    1. About - Provides information about the Church and its pastors.
    2. Program - Providing detailed information on the specific event, what its main focus is and the day it is run on.
    3. Video - User has the option to watch a video which is changed on a weekly basis.
* Gallery page, where the user can see a collage of images of its members, taken from past events. 
* Contact Us, which takes the user to a form that can be filled out if he/she wishes to make contact. But also provides the address and phone number which allows the user to initiate the first contact.  
* Footer, which contains links to the church's social media accounts, where the user can learn more or use that as a means of contact also. 


### The Skeleton
The website consists of 3 pages. Home, Gallery, and Contact Us. Here are the wireframes that were used in the construction of the site.

* [PC View](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/wire-frames/pc.png)

Here I have been planning my color schemes for the website.
At the End I have decided to stick to the Yellow/off white shades.

## The Surface and Features

### Header, Logo, Navbar and Hero Image
Logo and navigation are displayed the same on all pages of the website. The Hero image, however, is only displayed on the landing page.

On larger Devices Logo is displayed to the left and the Navigation bar to the right. 

On mobile and smaller screens however, a hamburger icon is displayed which expands when clicked.

### Contact Us
The contact form is centered throughout the different screen sizes. It features an image background and address and contact number which I have placed in the same container. 

The form allows the User to interact with the page to submit their name, number and a brief message explaining their query. The information provided by the user is sent to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ for now, but that will be changed in the future.
