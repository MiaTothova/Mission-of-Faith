Mission of Faith is a website designed to showcase and advertise this Christian Evangelical church located in Ennis Co. Clare. Its main goal is to provide useful information about the church and what programs it runs on a weekly basis. Its main objective is to showcase its importance and place in the local community. The Gallery page is full of images from past sermons and events, showcasing its attention to detail and especially its involvement in children's development and focusing on their youth members.   

#### The Business goals of the website are:
* To increase awareness among the Christian community about the importance of living by the scripture. 
* To spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to non-believers. 
* To invite curious non-members to visit the church.
#### The customers visit the website to:
*  Learn more about the church and its Pastors. 
*  Learn about the weekly programs that are run. 
* Watch the “sermon of the week” that gets published every week.
* See pictures from past events.
* To find its contact and location.
* To establish contact with the pastors or members of the team. 


# UX
I aimed to create a website that is simple to navigate and follow. I aimed for a simplistic design with light colors so that it is easy to read without being too overwhelming on the eyes. 

### The ideal client:
* English speaking 
* Located in Ennis Co. Clare and surrounding area
* Christian or is curious about Christianity 
* Values involvement in the local community 
### The website will help clients to:
* Navigate easily through the website 
* Find the contact and location 
* Learn about the church and its pastors 
* Find the specific days of programs that are run each week
* Use the form provided to request a call back or ask aquestion
* See Images of its church community from past events 

### User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to know what the website is about. 
2. As a new visitor, I want to learn about the aim of the website, what it is about and who runs the congregation.  
3. As a new visitor, I want to know what the usual program schedule is. 
4. As a new visitor, I want to connect to any social media pages the church has. 
5. As a new visitor, I want to see the best way to contact the church. 


### The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features my website:
* Header containing the logo and the menu bar including Home, Gallery and Contact Us links. 
* Home page split into 3 sections : 
    1. About - Provides information about the Church and its pastors.
    2. Program - Providing detailed information on the specific event, what its main focus is and the day it is run on.
    3. Video - User has the option to watch a video which is changed on a weekly basis.
* Gallery page, where the user can see a collage of images of its members, taken from past events. 
* Contact Us, which takes the user to a form that can be filled out if he/she wishes to make contact. But also provides the address and phone number which allows the user to initiate the first contact.  
* Footer, which contains links to the church's social media accounts, where the user can learn more or use that as a means of contact also. 
* The use of media queries allows for responsiveness on different screen sizes. 


### The Skeleton
The website consists of 3 pages. Home, Gallery, and Contact Us. Here are the wireframes that were used in the construction of the site.  

* [Mobile View](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/wire-frames/mobile.png)

* [Tablet View](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/wire-frames/tablet.png)

* [PC View](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/wire-frames/pc.png)

Here I have been planning my color schemes for the website.
At the End I have decided to stick to the Yellow/off-white/greyish shades.

## The Surface and Features

### Header, Logo, Navbar and Hero Image
Logo and navigation are displayed the same on all pages of the website. The Hero image, however, is only displayed on the landing page. 

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/logo-nav-hero.png)

On larger Devices Logo is displayed to the left and the Navigation bar to the right. 

On mobile and smaller screens however, a hamburger icon is displayed which expands when clicked.

### About Section
The About Section consists of two parts: About Us and Meet the Pastors. Each part gives a detailed paragraph with information about each. 

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/about.png)

### Program Section
The Program section consists of 4 sub-sections. Each sub-section includes its own image. The sub-sections represent a program on a particular day of the week on which it's run and contains detailed information. 

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/program.png)

### Sermon of the week and the Footer
Sermon of the week provides a video and a brief description. The videos are changed on a weekly basis to reflect the church's focus for that week. 

The footer contains all navigation links and copyright information. 

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/footer.png)

Overall, the main Home page displays all images, text and video in a in 1 long column with each item centered on the page.

### The Gallery 
The Gallery page is Responsive, displaying 1 column on mobile devices gradually increasing column number based on the size of the screen.

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/gallery-small.png)

### Contact Us
The contact form is centered throughout the different screen sizes. It features an image background and address and contact number which I have placed in the same container. 

The form allows the User to interact with the page to submit their name, number and a brief message explaining their query. The information provided by the user is sent to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/ for now, but that will be changed in the future.

## Testing

1. As a new visitor, I want to know what the website is about. 
 * The landing page provides enough visual evidence for this. We have the hero image showing a worship group performing at the altar. The Who we are, and Meet our Pastors also provides detailed insight into the pages aim. In the Program section, the headings and images also provide enough visual and reading material about the page. 

2. As a new visitor, I want to learn about the aim of the website, what it is about and who runs the congregation. 
 * This is very evident from the underlined Headings and reading material provided in the About Section. 

3. As a new visitor, I want to know what the usual program schedule is. 
 * The straightforward structure of the Program section using text and images provides this. 

4. As a new visitor, I want to connect to any social media pages the church has. 
 * The social media links are provided in the footer on all 3 pages of the website. Each icon that is clicked opens in a new tab leading the use into the specific social media platform. 

5. As a new visitor, I want to see the best way to contact the church. 
 * The Contact Us page provides a form which the user can fill out, proving their name, phone number and brief message. The user, however, can also use the phone number and address provided. 

### Aditional Testing

When running the Lighthouse validation in Devtools for the first time,  I have received this score  :

![](https://github.com/MiaTothova/Mission-of-Faith/blob/main/readme-images/lighthouse.png)

But after noticing that W3C Markup Validation Service was giving a warning in my gallery.html page about a h2 tag not being present in my section id="gallery" 

So, to fix the W3C validation I have included a h2 tag in the gallery section to fix this warning, as I didn't want that to affect my grade.  
 
After this I ran the Lighthouse validation in Devtools again. But after doing that it has dropped my Performance has dropped from 83 to 66. So, I am not too pleased about that.

### Bugs
When testing the site using Devtools I have noticed a white space appears underneath the header when the page loads and then disappears. I have concluded that this must be due to some margin css clashing together. I used Bootstrap when first styling the form as I was trying to figure out the best approach. But have reverted to only css. I did however continue to style my pages without removing the Bootstrap link from my head section. I believe this is what is causing the issue. I will be focusing on fixing this in the future.

## Acknowledgement
I have decided to make this website for my local church. All they have is a fakebook page and I have asked for permission to use them as an idea for a webpage. They gave me permission to include their images and were very excited about the whole idea. 

I want to thank my mentor and my course coordinator for pushing me in the right direction, as well as providing inspiration. And thanks to Student support, in helping fix small bits of code to help pass it through the Validators.
