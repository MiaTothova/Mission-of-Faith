            <br>
            <p>Pastor's Marcus's journey in ministry began in 2002 when they felt the call to serve God and His people.

              of Scripture and a compassionate approach to ministry. Their leadership is characterized by humility,
              grace,
              and a genuine desire to see lives transformed by the power of God's Word. </p>
