          <h4>Youth Friday</h4>
          <p>Every Friday evening, teens and young adults

          <h4>Worship Sunday</h4>
          <p>Our Sunday family sermon is the cornerstone of our weekly worship experience. Each Sunday morning, families
            come together to lift their voices in praise, receive biblical teaching, and deepen their connection with
            God
            and one another. Led by our dedicated pastoral team, the sermon is a time for us to draw near to God, seek
            His
            guidance, and be transformed by His Word. With messages rooted in Scripture and relevant to our daily lives,
            the Sunday sermon provides spiritual nourishment and practical insights that equip us to live out our faith
            with joy and authenticity.

          <h4>Sunday School</h4>
          <p>Sunday Children's School is a vibrant program that runs concurrently with our Sunday worship service. While
            parents have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Scripture and engage in worship, our dedicated
            team
            of teachers and volunteers leads our children in age-appropriate Bible lessons, activities, and crafts.
            Sunday
            Children's School not only provides a valuable break for parents but also ensures that our youngest members
            are given the opportunity to learn about God's love and truth in a way that is engaging and relevant to
            their
            lives. It's a time for our children to grow in their understanding of Scripture, build lasting friendships,
            and experience the joy of discovering God's plan for their lives. Join us this Sunday and entrust your
            children to our caring and capable team as we journey together in faith.
